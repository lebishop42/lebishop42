#### Hello, I'm Louise and I started learning to code because:
:stars: I'm fascinated by the world of data and amazed by what we can do with and show through it.

:stars: I'm excited by the level of sophistication and flexibility that coding allows in data analysis and visualations, and eager to harness this.

:stars: I look forward to being able to being able to tell unusual and engaging stories to people from all walks of life with my new found skills. 
   
#### So I've been learning:
* Python :snake:
* SQL
* HTML and CSS (more slowly but on my radar) and
    
***Random fact***: I love making clothes (mostly for kids) and you can see some of my makes [here](https://whalesandwhiskers.co.uk).
