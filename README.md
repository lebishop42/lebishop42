#### Hello, I'm Louise, welcome to my space:
# About me:
ðŸŒ  I initially trained as a lawyer but always found the most persuasive arguments are those backed by numbers.

ðŸŒ  I get a lot of satisfaction from problem-solving and even more so when these are code-based and allow me to learn new skills along the way.

ðŸŒ  Lastly, I love being able to tell unique and engaging stories to diverse audiencces with a good set of data visuals.
